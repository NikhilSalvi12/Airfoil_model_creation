# Airfoil_model_creation

# Data:-
Data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments.

# Libraries Used:-
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. sklearn
6. scipy

# Objective:-
1. Import dataset.
2. Analysis of the dataset.
3. EDA and Visualization of Dataset.
4. creating a Linear regression model.
5. Finding the best values and deploying the model.

# Plots Used:-
1. Pairplot
2. Boxplot
3. Heatmap
4. probplot

# Inference Drawn:-
Needed to apply different regressions or polynomial features to get better accuracy, **current accuracy is 62.75%**
